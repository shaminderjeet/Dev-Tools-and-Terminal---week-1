<h2 class="center"><u>Introduction</u></h2>
<p>India, our country is a huge and beautiful land full of wonders. From the Himalayas to the Indian Ocean, Desert of Thar in the snowy mountains of Sikkim, it is a country full of beautiful landscapes and beautiful people. India is a unique country with diversity. "Unity is diversity" is the main slogan of the country</p>
<p>My country is a land of villages and fields full of bodies. I am proud of his village from which the Indian civilization flourished. Most of the great leaders of our country came from villages. Our fields are fed by mighty rivers like Ganges, Yamuna, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Narmada, Krishna and Kavery . The Gangetic Valley is the most fertile region of our country
<p>Basically, Indian culture is tolerant and absorbing. His nature is assimilative. The democratic installation facilitates the process. Diversity in all aspects of society serves as a source of strength and wealth. The different ways of worshiping and believing represent the underlying uniformity . They promote a spirit of harmony and fraternity. This goes beyond all considerations of religious, regional, linguistic diversity.</p>
<p>India is rich in dialects and languages. Twenty-two languages constitutionally enjoy official language status, but Hindi is recognized as the lingua franca of the nation. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and from Nagaland to Mumbai, Hindi is understood as the national language of India. Although different regions have different regional affiliations, they are all Indian. People are called Bihari , Punjabi, Kashmiri, Marathi, Gujarati, but they are proud to say that they are Indians. </p>
